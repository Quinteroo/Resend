>[!IMPORTANT]
> Resend doesn't support CommonJS, so you have to modify your package.json and add **"type":"module"**

>[!WARNING]
> To avoid syntax problems between CommonJS and Module ES6, when modifying the package.json with type:module you have to rename the files that are being executed in Common.JS with the .cjs extension and modify them in the package.json.
